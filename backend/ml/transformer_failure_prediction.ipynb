    "# Transformer Thermal Stress Prediction with Snowflake ML\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Temporal Prediction - Identify transformers that will be HIGH RISK at 4 PM based on 8 AM state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engineering**: This is a REAL ML problem with genuine uncertainty (target: 75-85% accuracy)\n",
    "- Unlike threshold detection (99.9% accuracy = data leakage), temporal prediction has predictive signal but isn't deterministic\n",
    "- Operators need to know at 8 AM which transformers to monitor/preemptively cool by 4 PM\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Value**:\n",
    "- Reduce unplanned outages by predicting transformer stress 8 hours in advance\n",
    "- Enable proactive load management and cooling system activation\n",
    "- Optimize crew deployment for potential emergency repairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake ML Capabilities Demonstrated**:\n",
    "1. **Snowpark ML** - Feature engineering and model training\n",
    "2. **ML Experiments** - Hyperparameter tracking and model comparison\n",
    "3. **Snowflake Model Registry** - Model versioning and deployment\n",
    "4. **Model Explainability (SHAP)** - Transparent, auditable predictions\n",
    "5. **ML Lineage** - Full traceability from source data to model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source**: 2M+ temporal training records (8 AM → 4 PM state transitions, July 2025)\n",

    "### ML Problem: Temporal Prediction (Not Threshold Detection)\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Problem | Accuracy | Realistic? |\n",
    "|----------|---------|----------|------------|\n",
    "| Threshold Detection | \"Is load > 100%?\" | 99.9% | ❌ Trivial, no ML needed |\n",
    "| **Temporal Prediction** | \"Will 8 AM state become high-risk at 4 PM?\" | 75-85% | ✅ Real uncertainty |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: \n",
    "- 48.6% of already-high-risk transformers at 8 AM stay high-risk at 4 PM (not 100%!)\n",
    "- 4.4% of borderline transformers (90-100% load) become high-risk by afternoon\n",
    "- The ML model learns patterns that simple thresholds miss\n",
