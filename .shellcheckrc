# See https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/

# Enable all checks by default, disable specific ones as needed
enable=all

# Disable some checks that are intentional in our scripts:
# SC2034: Variable appears unused (we use dynamic variable names)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (stylistic choice)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing (sometimes intentional)
disable=SC2034,SC2155

# External sources that we source
external-sources=true

# Shell dialect
shell=bash
